# Object-Detection-with-Yolo3-model-and-impacts-of-imbalance-and-few-shot-on-model-s-performance



## 1. Introduction:
This project focus on understading deeply about the ideas and implementation of object detection model (YOLO3) that include:
- Model architecture
- Model performance metric
- Loss function
- Training and tuning model
- Model prediction
- Detailed implementation

I also researched the impacts of class imbalance and few-shot learning (training model with limited samples) on model performance. This project is final thesis of my master degree in University of Glasgow.
