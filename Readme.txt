Due to large volume of data and trained weights, I have to break some folders into smallers folders.
Please read "Software Descriptions.xlsx" file to know the software hierarchy and know where to put files
in each folder. For complete view and execution, please jump to "http://51.105.8.58/hub/user/kevin-vn642/lab" 
if you can access.

Some notes:
	- Trained weights can get from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GzpforsJidOa6z_JGAoaoQ39l2ocMpYc/view?usp=sharing
	  trained weight, backend files must put into yolo3 folder
	- Augmented data and data cleaning work can get from link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jHNu4k6ZphA9NTIDZ15LFp14lSZUZ8O6/view?usp=sharing
	  folder "crop", "Process_original_images" must put in "annotations" folder
	- Original images are stored in University Lab Server and can not be downloaded as they are located in many different folders.
	  You can view some images from "crop" folder.
